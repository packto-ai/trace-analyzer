{"ragged_proto": true, "proto_store": {"Tell me about all the Network Protocols": "Certainly! Network protocols are sets of rules governing how data is transmitted between devices in a network. They define the format, timing, sequencing, and error checking of data transmission. Here are some of the most commonly used network protocols:\n\n### 1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**\n- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications. It establishes a connection before sending data and ensures that all data is received correctly.\n- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Responsible for addressing and routing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination.\n\n### 2. **HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**\n- **HTTP**: The foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web. It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various commands.\n- **HTTPS**: An extension of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS for security, ensuring that data is encrypted during transmission.\n\n### 3. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**\n- A simpler, connectionless protocol that does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or data integrity. It is used for applications that require low latency and can tolerate some packet loss, such as streaming audio or video.\n\n### 4. **DNS (Domain Name System)**\n- Translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.\n\n### 5. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**\n- Used for transferring files between a client and a server on a computer network. It supports both text and binary data.\n\n### 6. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**\n- Used for sending and relaying outgoing mail between email servers.\n\n### 7. **POP3/IMAP (Post Office Protocol/Internet Message Access Protocol)**\n- **POP3**: Used by local email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server.\n- **IMAP**: Allows email clients to access email on a remote mail server as if the messages were local.\n\n### 8. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**\n- Automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.\n\n### 9. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**\n- Used for network diagnostics and error reporting. Tools like ping and traceroute use ICMP.\n\n### 10. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**\n- Used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in a local network.\n\n### 11. **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)**\n- Provides secure communication over a computer network by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server.\n\n### 12. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**\n- Used for network management and monitoring network devices.\n\n### 13. **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**\n- Used to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network.\n\n### 14. **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**\n- Used for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions such as voice and video calls over IP networks.\n\n### 15. **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)**\n- Used for delivering audio and video over IP networks. It is often used in conjunction with SIP.\n\nThese protocols work together to enable the complex interactions and data exchanges that occur over the internet and other networks. Each protocol has its own specific role and set of rules to ensure efficient and reliable communication."}, "already_printed": false, "chat_history": "You: What's the router?<br>Packto: The router is 00:10:94:00:00:02,08:00:27:fc:6a:c9,00:00:00:00:00:00<br><br>You: so there are 3 routers?<br>Packto: Yes, there are 3 routers:<br><br>- 00:10:94:00:00:02<br>- 08:00:27:fc:6a:c9<br>- 00:00:00:00:00:00<br><br>You: Hello!<br>Packto: Hello!
