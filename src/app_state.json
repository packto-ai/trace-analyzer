{"ragged_proto": true, "proto_store": {"Tell me about all the Network Protocols": "Certainly! Network protocols are sets of rules governing how data is transmitted between devices in a network. They define the format, timing, sequencing, and error checking of data transmission. Here are some of the most commonly used network protocols:\n\n### 1. **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)**\n- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications.\n- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Responsible for addressing and routing packets between devices.\n\n### 2. **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**\n- Used for transmitting web pages and other data on the World Wide Web.\n- **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)**: Secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS for encryption.\n\n### 3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**\n- Used for transferring files between a client and a server on a network.\n- **SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)**: Secure version of FTP that uses SSH for encryption.\n\n### 4. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)**\n- Used for sending and relaying outgoing mail between email servers.\n\n### 5. **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)**\n- Used by local email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server.\n\n### 6. **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)**\n- Used by email clients to access emails on a mail server.\n\n### 7. **DNS (Domain Name System)**\n- Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses.\n\n### 8. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**\n- Automatically assigns IP addresses and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network.\n\n### 9. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**\n- Provides a simple, connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanisms.\n\n### 10. **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**\n- Used for network diagnostics and error reporting, such as the ping command.\n\n### 11. **ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**\n- Used to map IP addresses to MAC addresses in a local network.\n\n### 12. **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)**\n- Used for network management and monitoring network devices.\n\n### 13. **SSH (Secure Shell)**\n- Provides a secure channel over an unsecured network for remote login and other network services.\n\n### 14. **Telnet**\n- Provides a command-line interface for communicating with a remote device or server.\n\n### 15. **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**\n- Used to synchronize the clocks of computers over a network.\n\n### 16. **SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security)**\n- Provides secure communication over a network by encrypting data.\n\n### 17. **VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)**\n- Used for transmitting voice communications over IP networks.\n\n### 18. **SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)**\n- Used for signaling and controlling multimedia communication sessions such as voice and video calls.\n\n### 19. **RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol)**\n- Used for delivering audio and video over IP networks.\n\n### 20. **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**\n- Used for exchanging routing information between autonomous systems on the Internet.\n\n### 21. **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**\n- Used for finding the best path for routing IP packets within a single routing domain.\n\n### 22. **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**\n- Used for routing IP packets within a small to medium-sized network.\n\n### 23. **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)**\n- Used for routing IP packets within a large network.\n\n### 24. **PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol)**\n- Used for dial-up connections between two routers.\n\n### 25. **PPPoE (PPP over Ethernet)**\n- Used for establishing a PPP session over an Ethernet connection.\n\nThese protocols work together to enable various types of communication and data transfer over networks, from simple web browsing to complex enterprise applications."}}
